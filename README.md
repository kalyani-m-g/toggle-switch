What did you learn while making this app?
I learned how to implement a theme toggle using CSS variables and the data-theme attribute, moving away from brittle class-based hacks. I also grasped how to persist theme preferences using localStorage and apply them early in page load to avoid visual flashes. This pattern aligns with industry guidance for theme persistence and smooth UX.

What feature did you enjoy building the most?
Adding the theme toggle that preserves user preference was the best part. It’s one thing to switch themes, but making that choice stick across visits—without running into page flash issues—is where it felt clever and complete.

What would you add next if you had more time?
 I'd add system-level detection and automatic switching, plus a cookie-based approach for backend-rendered dark-mode support. This would improve initial load consistency and eliminate any flash of the wrong theme before my JS runs.
